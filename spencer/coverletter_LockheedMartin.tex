\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Spencer George I am , thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Senior Software Engineer Level 3 role at Lockheed Martin. I found this position through LinkedIn. After reviewing the job description, it's clear that the engineering team is looking for an engineer that is familiar with software, firmware and electronics. Advancing sUAS technology such as Indago would be such an awesome position. I have found working on embedded software that can be remotely controlled as an interesting system to work on.  

Over the course of my career I have been writing code in C and \Cpp  at IBM, Novell, LANDesk, and SoftHaven. A side project that I completed was done in C with Arduino microprocessors to simulate duck feeding behavior. In order to verify code I have used automated unit, integration and system testing to improve development velocity and quality. Further tests were completed by writing and executing test plans by myself or others. 

At Harman International and ClearOne I used software simulators and FPGAs as methods of developing audio processing equipment. Oscilloscopes, power supplies, and digital multi-meters where used to provide power and measure input/output of the system. I am familiar with electrical schematics after having taken a college course in solid state electronics.

Although I am not experienced in sUAS, I am familiar with RC aircraft. I have cloned the Ardupilot repository and built the code so that I can expand my knowledge of working with autonomous devices and the planning software. This is an area of engineering that I am excited and enthralled to learn. I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly and perform above expectations.

\lettersection{Why Lockheed Martin?}
I am an adaptable professional who has been consistently praised as quality-oriented by my co-workers and management. Over the course of my 30-year career I have developed the skills directly relevant to the Senior Software Engineer role you are hiring for, including C, \Cpp, and Python. Overall, I have consistently demonstrated problem solving, critical thinking, and multitasking abilities in every aspect of my Senior Software Engineer role at Lockheed-Martin, and I invite you to review my detailed achievements in the attached resume.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on my my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me at 801-369-1012 or via email at provocamper@gmail.com to arrange for a convenient meeting time.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon,
