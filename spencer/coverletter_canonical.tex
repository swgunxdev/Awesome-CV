%%% Write content for your cover letter


In university or through your career, describe your achievements that you are particularly proud of.
Teaching myself to program in C with Lightspeed C on my Mac.
Building my own 20 MB hard drive for my Mac 512KE.
Installing Linux kernel 0.99.5 on my pc after using gopher to download the 30 or so 3.5 floppy disks for the slackware distro.
Getting hired by IBM.
Making the decision to learn an shell(bash), interpreted(python_1.7) and compiled(c++) programming language.
Deciding to collect programming languages and learn how to create my own.


How would you describe your level of experience as a professional software engineer?


Describe your Linux administration experience skill and how you have acquired that
As stated earlier I started learning Linux with the installation of very early distros of Slackware on my pc. I learned to deal with partitioning on single and multiple drive systems. Since this was just a home computer I learned to configure dialup so I could connect to the internet. It was not until I got my job at Novell that I really started administrating UNIX boxes. I knew about the differences between Linux and UNIX, but not experienced it yet. A senior software engineer mentored me through the process of maintaining five different UNIX operating systems, which were SunOS, Solaris, DEC Unix, HP/UX, AIX and Linux. Together we assembled a Linux file server for the engineering organization. This server was attached via NFS to by all of development boxes per operating system. We maintained the system for 45 developers and the EDirectory build team for about 1.5 years. 


Describe your Python software development skill and how you have acquired that
I made Python my choice because it is readable, modular, portable, and extensible. I tested the use of Basic, Forth, Perl, Pascal, Modula, Lisp, and Python. Lisp and Perl are too easily unreadable. Basic is well basic. Forth,Pascal, Modula and Lisp were a challenge in finding versions that worked on Mac, Linux, and Windows so I could have portable code. Python was both a choice of testing and I enjoyed using it. 
At LANDesk I was tasked with using Python to create an installer 

Describe your experience with SQL and relational data modeling, and summarize your learning with large-scale database backed applications

Describe your experience of web front-end and back-end development 


What would you like to achieve in career development and skills development?

How are you involved in open source software?


What interests you about working for Canonical?
