\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Spencer George I am, thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Senior Software Engineer at Recursion. I have over 10 years of experience, known especially for backend infrastructure solutions.

I have used Python as the intercepted language of choice for both professional and personal projects for a long time. Like Python, PostgreSQL is my preferred database. At Newfold I used Docker containers with Kubernetes(Openshift) to deliver 9 projects to completion. These projects were RESTful microservices used throughout the company. I used JavaScript and React to provide the user interfaces for 4 projects such as the Black Friday ads and a new hosting onboarding process

I have recently taught myself Go 

Although I am not experienced in sUAS, I am familiar with RC aircraft. I have cloned the Ardupilot repository and built the code so that I can expand my knowledge of working with autonomous devices and the planning software. This is an area of engineering that I am excited and enthralled to learn. I am certain that I have the necessary skills to successfully do the job adeptly and perform above expectations.

\lettersection{Why Recursion?}
I am an adaptable professional who has consistently been praised as quality-oriented by my co-workers and management. I have developed the skills directly relevant to the Senior Software Engineer role you are hiring for, including solid fundamentals, data structures, API development and a willingness to work well with others. I invite you to review my detailed achievements in the attached resume.

\lettersection{Why Me?}
After reviewing my resume, I hope you will agree that I am the type of competent and competitive candidate you are looking for. I look forward to elaborating on my my specific skills and abilities will benefit your organization. Please contact me at 801-369-1012 or via email at provocamper@gmail.com to arrange for a convenient meeting time.

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon,
