\lettersection{About Me}
My name is Spencer George I am , thank you for the opportunity to apply for the Python Engineer role at Canonical. I found this position through LinkedIn. After reading the job description I immediately wanted to apply for this position. I have been using Python as my interpreted language of choice starting around 1995 as I was getting my degree. I was working for IBM at the time and needed a way to conditionally patch portions of file systems together. With a tree walking object, date time logic and a CSV reader I was able to accomplish this quickly. I have continued to use Python for many years and jobs.

\lettersection{Why Me?}

Thank you for your consideration, and I look forward to hearing from you soon,
